	abstract = {Religion in Russia is diverse with Christianity, especially Russian Orthodoxy being the most widely professed faith, but with significant minorities of non-religious people and adherents of other faiths. A 1997 law on religion recognises the right to freedom of conscience and creed to all the citizenry, the spiritual contribution of Orthodox Christianity to the history of Russia, and respect to "Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions and creeds which constitute an inseparable part of the historical heritage of Russia's peoples", including ethnic religions or Paganism, either preserved or revived. According to the law, any religious organisation may be recognised as "traditional" if it was already in existence before 1982, and each newly founded religious group has to provide its credentials and re-register yearly for fifteen years, and, in the meantime until eventual recognition, stay without rights.The Russian Orthodox Church, though its influence is thin in some parts of Siberia and southern Russia, where there has been a "remarkable revival of pre-Christian religion", acts as the de facto if not de jure privileged religion of the state, claiming the right to decide which other religions or denominations are to be granted the right of registration. Some Protestant churches which were already in existence before the Russian Revolution have been unable to re-register, and the Catholic Church has been forbidden to develop its own territorial jurisdictions. According to some Western observers, respect for freedom of religion by Russian authorities has declined since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses are currently banned in Russia.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 there has been a revival and spread of Siberian shamanism (often mixed with Orthodox elements), and the emergence of Hindu and new religious movements throughout Russia. There has been an "exponential increase in new religious groups and alternative spiritualities", Eastern religions and Neopaganism, even among self-defined "Christians"—a term which has become a loose descriptor for a variety of eclectic views and practices. Russia has been defined by the scholar Eliot Borenstein as the "Southern California of Europe" because of such a blossoming of new religious movements, and the latter are perceived by the Russian Orthodox Church as competitors in a "war for souls". However, the multiplicity of religions in Russia have been traditional components of Russian identities for hundreds of years, contributing to a long-established ethno-cultural pluralism.},

	abstract = {The Democratic Republic of the Congo forms part of the Congo River Basin, which covers an area of almost 1,000,000 square kilometres (390,000 sq mi). The country's only outlet to the Atlantic Ocean is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Congo River.
The vast, low-lying central area is a plateau-shaped basin sloping toward the west, covered by tropical rainforest and criss-crossed by rivers, a large area of this has been categorized by the World Wildlife Fund as the Central Congolian lowland forests ecoregion. The forest center is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest. 
Dense grasslands extend beyond the Congo River in the north. High mountains of the Ruwenzori Range (some above 5,000 m or 16,000 ft) are found on the eastern borders with Rwanda and Uganda (see Albertine Rift montane forests for a description of this area).},

Le seul débouché maritime du pays est une étroite bande de territoire sur la rive nord du fleuve (région de Moanda dans le Bas-Congo).
La vaste zone de basse altitude du centre du pays est un plateau façonné par le bassin du fleuve s'écoulant vers l'ouest, et couvert d'une importante forêt tropicale. Cette zone est entourée de terraces montagneuses telles que les Monts Mitumba à l'est et les montagnes des Virunga au nord, de plateaux couverts de savanes au sud et au sud-ouest, le nord étant bordé au-delà du fleuve par la dense forêt. De hautes montagnes se trouvent à l'extrémité orientale du pays (région du Grand-Rift).
La {RDC} est traversée par l'équateur, avec un tiers du pays se trouvant au nord de cette ligne. Le climat est chaud et humide dans la région du bassin fluvial, et plus sec et plus frais vers le sud. Au sud de l'équateur, la saison des pluies dure d'octobre à mai, et au nord d'avril à novembre. Au niveau de l'équateur, les précipitations sont relativement constantes tout au long de l'année. Durant la saison des pluies, les orages sont violents mais ne durent que quelques heures. Le niveau de précipitations moyen pour l'ensemble du pays est de 107 centimètres d'eau.},

Roughly 98\% of Belgium's overseas territory was just one colony (about 76 times larger than Belgium itself) — known as the Belgian Congo. This had originated as the personal property of the country's king, Leopold {II}, rather than being gained through the political or military action of the Belgian state. Sovereignty was transferred to Belgium in 1908.},
